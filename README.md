# Movie Recommender System üé¨ 
In this project, we will be using python libraries in order to create a basic movie recommender system.

## Problem Description üéØ
According to Skaih in 2025, there are now recorded to be at least 698,754 published in the entire world. We live in a world full of media being released every single day, with some movies published in different studios or published in indie scenes, with different genres and different languages. There's simply too much media that one can consume, and we can get overwhelmed with the amount of choices that we can choose from.

According to Pilat and Krastev in 2024, the phenomenon of being overwhelmed by choices is called ‚Äúthe paradox of choices‚Äù. When the number of choices increases, so does the difficulty of knowing what is best. Instead of increasing our freedom to have what we want, the paradox of choice suggests that having too many choices actually limits our freedom. 

Major studio films dominate the film industry, making the thousands of quality independent and international films undiscovered to the masses. According to Shaw in 2023, smaller movies are struggling to attract viewers while Hollywood is cutting spending and taking fewer risks. Streaming services also worsen the problem, making their movie recommender system be based more about popularity than actual film content. Indie filmmakers must contend with big-budget productions and established franchises, which often receive preferential treatment in promotional efforts and algorithmic recommendations. As a result, indie films risk being overshadowed by high-profile releases, hindering their ability to attract viewers and gain traction on streaming platforms. (Oluchi, 2024)

With our project, **we aim to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences to make the process of finding movies that you‚Äôd want to watch simpler.**
